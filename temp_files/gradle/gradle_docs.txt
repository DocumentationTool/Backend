Adding new Dependency:

All Project Dependencies are globaly defined in buildSrc/ProjectDependencies.Groovy

Any new Dependency that is needed by 1 or more modules should be defined there, (or if an existing one exists used instead)

This keeps all dependencies central and easy to update for all modules.



Adding a new Module:

create a new folder in root

inside this folder should be a build.gradle file, as well as registering the module in the root/settings.gradle file as shown here:


include('Doc-Api',"Doc-Core")

Any module specified here will contain defaults:

    apply plugin: 'java'

    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }


any specific dependency should be added in each individual modules build.gradle file as seen here:


dependencies {
    implementation(project(':Doc-Core'))
    implementation ProjectDependencies.SpringStarterWeb
    implementation ProjectDependencies.SpringStarter
    testImplementation ProjectDependencies.Junit
}
