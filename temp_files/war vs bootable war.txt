Almost â€” but not always. Here's the quick answer:

âœ… bootWar is better in most modern Spring Boot projects, especially if:
You're deploying to the cloud, Docker, or as a standalone app.

You want easy java -jar myapp.war execution.

You're using Spring Boot the way it was designed â€” self-contained apps with embedded servers.

Butâ€¦

ðŸ›‘ bootWar is not always the best if:
You must deploy to an existing external servlet container (like a legacy corporate Tomcat server).

In that case, war might be more appropriate unless you configure your app to support external deployment via SpringBootServletInitializer.

You don't want an embedded server, for size, security, or company policy reasons.

bootWar bundles an embedded Tomcat (or Jetty/Undertow), which increases file size.

âœ… TL;DR Recommendation:
If you're...	Use
Building a modern Spring Boot app with embedded server	bootWar
Deploying to Docker, Kubernetes, Heroku, etc.	bootWar
Deploying to a legacy app server (e.g., company Tomcat)	war (or a specially configured bootWar)
Need both?	Use bootWar, and implement SpringBootServletInitializer
If you're curious, I can show you how to configure bootWar to support both embedded and traditional deployment!
