How to allow fast searching of text but keep it self contained?


if it were non self contained elasticsearch would be the way to go but we want it self contained


Decision for fts5 sticks out, was made to store / sort them in that way.

fts5 default doesn't support middle word search so I set the mode to: trigram
as seen here: "CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE renderedPages USING fts5(resourcePath, content, tokenize='trigram');"

at the cost of tripple file size
